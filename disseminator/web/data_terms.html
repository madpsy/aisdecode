<h2>What Happens When You Send AIS Data to Us?</h2>

<p>When you send AIS (Automatic Identification System) data to us, we use this information to track and display relevant vessel data, such as location, navigation details, and identification information. The AIS data you provide is publicly available and typically includes information such as a vessel's position, course, and speed.</p>

<p>We also ask you to update your <strong>current IP address</strong> when sending the data. This helps us <strong>link the data you send</strong> with the <strong>receiver’s location details</strong> on the map, providing better context for the vessel data you’ve decoded and sent to us.</p>

<p>The only personal information we collect is the <strong>receiver’s identifier</strong> (who is sending the data), which we use solely to associate the data with the receiver’s location. We do not share or expose any personal details beyond this identifier.</p>

<p>You retain control over your data and can stop sending it at any time. If you choose to stop sending data or withdraw consent, we will cease processing your information, and any previously collected data can be erased upon request.</p>

<p>For further details on how we handle your data, including your rights to access, modify, or delete your information, please refer to our <a href="YOUR_PRIVACY_POLICY_LINK" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>.</p>
